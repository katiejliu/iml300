[Period.](https://katiejliu.github.io/iml300/project-1/) is an interactive web experience about getting your first period. 

### Description

Period is an interactive experience following a girl receiving her first period. The storyline is very unexpected as there is no sign of a period, until suddenly she gets it, which is very similar to the experiences of many women. It is shocking for both the girl and the viewers. Separately there is the necessity to pick up a quarter on the ground, which is later used to purchase either a pad or tampon. When directed to pick up the quarter, there is no sign of the later use for it which speaks to the unfair use of money tied to feminine hygiene products. I believe feminine hygiene products should be free in public bathrooms. If the user does not pick up a quarter, they are redirected to the beginning in order to do so. Moreover, the overall situation of receiving a period is repeated in a loop, mirroring the monthly cycle women go through.
